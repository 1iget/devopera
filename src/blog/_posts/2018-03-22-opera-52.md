Opera 52 (based on Chromium 65) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To
find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop blog post](https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2018/03/opera-52-offers-faster-ad-blocking-and-cool-new-animations/).
Here’s what it means for web developers.

## Paint Worklet, Paintlet, Paint API

With
[paintlets](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/paintapi)
it is possible to write a script that does the background rendering of
an element. This can be more flexible than generating images on the
server side or using client side generated data urls for backgrounds.

The image below is a rather silly example of what can be done with paintlets.

<img elem="media" src="{{ page.id }}/o52-paintlet.png" width="" alt="">

This effect was accomplished by [adding a paint
module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worklet/addModule)
to the paint worklet, and then, in its `paint()` method, drawing on
the supplied `ctx` as if it had been a canvas. It is also possible to
supply configuration from CSS to the script, something that can make
paintlets easier to use than other ways to generate background images.

    <!-- demo.html -->
    <style>
      textarea {
      background-image: paint(circlearcpainter);
      --circle-arc-pixel-size: 24;
      }
    </style>
    <!-- Textarea is a good demo since it can be resized. -->
    <textarea></textarea>
    <script>
      CSS.paintWorklet.addModule('circle_arc.js');
    </script>

The module itself is defined with the javascript below.

    // circle_arc.js
    class CircleArcPainter {
        circle_arc(ctx, x, y, radius, angle) {
            let angleInRad = (angle * 0.9 / 2 + 10) * Math.PI / 180;
            ctx.fillStyle = 'yellow';
            ctx.beginPath();
            ctx.arc(x, y, radius,
                    angleInRad, Math.PI * 2 - angleInRad, false);
            ctx.lineTo(x, y);
            ctx.closePath();
            ctx.fill();
        }
        static get inputProperties() { return ['--circle-arc-pixel-size']; }
        paint(ctx, geom, properties) {
            const css_prop = properties.get("--circle-arc-pixel-size");
            const size = css_prop ? parseInt(css_prop.toString()) : 100;
            ctx.fillStyle = "black";
            ctx.fillRect(0, 0, geom.width, geom.height);
            for (let x = 0; x < geom.width/size; x++) {
                for (let y = 0; y < geom.height/size; y++) {
                    const circle_size = Math.abs(
                        Math.sin((x + y) / 6)) * size / 4 + size / 12;
                    const opening = Math.random() * 90;
                    this.circle_arc(ctx, (x + 0.5) * size, (y + 0.5) * size,
                                    circle_size, opening);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Register our class under a specific name
    registerPaint('circlearcpainter', CircleArcPainter);


## Server Timing API

With the new [Server Timing API](https://w3c.github.io/server-timing/)
there is a well defined way for servers to pass performance
information to the browser through HTTP headers. With this information
web pages can make even better informed decisions.

In Developer Tools this information is displayed in the Network view
by selecting the resource and activating the Timing tab.

## CSS
* The
  [`:any-link`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:any-link)
  pseudo selector can be used to style both visited and non-visited
  links at the same time.
* For colors, the `rgb` and `hsl` functions now take an [optional
  fourth alpha](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#rgb-functions)
  value, making them identical to `rgba` and `hsla`.
* [`display:
  contents`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#box-generation)
  allows an element to wrap other elements without creating a box for
  itself.

## DOM
* There is now an
  [`assignedElements()`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-slot-assignedelements)
  on `<slot>` elements, which acts
  like `assignedNodes()` but only returns element nodes.
* [`HTMLAnchorElement.relList`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-link-rellist)
  will now give an accurate mapping of the `rel` attribute.
* [`document.all`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlallcollection)
  can no longer be overwritten.

## Feature Policy
* A new [feature policy](https://wicg.github.io/feature-policy/)
  `sync-xhr` will allow a site to block synchronous
  XMLHttpRequests. Synchronous XMLHttpRequests block scripts until a
  server has responded which can make them harmful for the user
  experience. If a site embeds untrusted, possibly malicious, content
  (think ads), this adds a tool to lock that content down a bit.

## Network
* The HTTPS code is updated to match the [draft-23
  version](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-tls13-23) of the
  TLS protocol.
* [`Request.destination`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-destination)
  is added to give service workers a better understanding of why a
  resource is fetched.

## Performance APIs
* A `toJSON()` method has been added to `PerformanceResourceTiming`,
  `PerformanceLongTaskTiming` and `TaskAttributionTiming`.

## Security
* The [download](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-hyperlink-download)
  attribute will be ignored on anchor elements with
  cross-origin attributes.
* Certificates from Symantec's Legacy PKI issued after 2017-12-01 will
  no longer be trusted. This will only affect sites that
  selected to not transition to DigiCert's new PKI. More information
  can be found in the [offical
  announcement](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/chromes-plan-to-distrust-symantec.html).
